# News Scraper Bot

## Description:
News Scraper Bot is a simple web spider written in Python that periodically scrapes news headlines from a selected news portal. The bot updates your database with the latest information, giving you an easy way to keep track of the latest news. The code can be easily customized and adapted for various news sites.

## Important
- HTML code structure and element classes may vary between news sites, so you may need to tailor the code to your specific portal.
- Replace https://example-news-website.com with the URL of the specific news portal you want to scrape.
- Scraping news sites may be subject to their terms of use, so make sure you follow the rules of the site you scrape.
